:wave: **Welcome to my website!**

I'm a PhD student in the School of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/">Arizona State University</a>, where I'm fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://search.asu.edu/profile/1176368">Prof. Gautam Dasarathy</a>. Before this, I earned my B.Tech degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from <a href="http://ec.pes.edu">PES University</a>, Bangalore, where I completed my undergraduate thesis under the guidance of <a href="http://sites.google.com/a/pes.edu/sanjeevg/">Prof. Sanjeev Gurugopinath</a>.

My research goal is to develop novel theory and statistically principled methodologies for learning and understanding fundamental network structures in complex interactive systems. A key focus is characterizing statistical complexity, computational efficiency, estimation accuracy, and their trade-offs under realistic network constraints and data collection processes. My research interests lie at the intersection of high-dimensional statistics, graphical models, network theory, and optimization.

 In my spare time, I like to read about the history of mathematics and mathematicians, I also enjoy hiking, swimming, playing chess (albeit poorly), and watching animated movies.

 **I am on the postdoctoral job market. Please feel free to reach out if you have an opening!**
